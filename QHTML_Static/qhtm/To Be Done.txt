Ideas for extensions
====================

What about a HTML message box. Identical to MessageBox except the text portion of the message
	box would be HTML. This would be much nicer than the plain text dialog box that appears.
	Users would be able to specify filenames, resource etc.
	Could easily replace the MFC mechanism because all of the AfxMessageBox(...) functions go through
	one standard function.
	Just one exported function from the DLL.


Scrolling HTML credits
	Could easily be accomplished using QHTM or a derived control. This should be hours work rather than days.
	No scroll bars.
	Mechanism to set the scroll position.
	Must work with out-of-bounds scroll position so the credits will scroll off the dialog totally.
	Another window class that is registered and a couple of extra messages sent perhaps (to change the scroll
	rate etc.).


Static link library
	Some users have asked for a static link library - should not be too hard but what about the other
	libraries such as libpng and paintlib.



Simple list of tasks that *should* be done.
===========================================


Background images.
	Does the background scroll with the other sections or is the background fixed.
	RG> This is determined by the watermark style, which is established like this:
		<body background="file.gif" bgproperties="fixed">
		The bgproperties="fixed" prevents the background from scrolling.


Transparent control.
	Make the entire control transparent. Why? For people with weird dialog box backgrounds.


Ordered and unordered lists.
	How? Could just bump the left margin until we get to the end of the list. As we
	go down the list we can simply add a section for the blob/number.
	We could ?probably? fake it by creating a table with two columns. Would this work? it might
	be the easy way.


JPEG support
Transparent/Animated GIF
Transparent PNG


Proper table wrapping.
	Tables that are right/left aligned should have text wrapped around it as per right/left align
	images. This should be no problem due to the already implemented wrapping(margin alterations)
	for images.


Style sheets.
	Full support needed.
	? What is involved in full implementation of CSS ?
	RG>	Good question. Better yet, how much of the spec is appropriate for this control?
		I don't expect to support DIVs, for example, but I would like CSS support for 
		standard tags (such as <a>, <h1>, etc.)


Forms support
	How much would be the minimum?
	What is involved?
	Why would we want forms support at all.


Override the defaults for the control.
	This would be similar to having a standard style sheet I guess.
	Basically add the ability for the default font, font size, background color, etc. to be overridden
	in one call. This would allow users to have much less HTML code and to allow them alter their pages in
	one fell swoop.


FRAMES
	Frames support would be nice.
	?How much is the least we can do?


Forms
	?Full support?


Allow selection
	Allow the user to select text/graphics etc. and copy the HTML to the clipboard.


EXTENSION - Specify links colours on a per link basis
	Add support for the link/alink attributes to the <A> tag, so that link colors can vary.


Use a Notification to allow the parent window to supply images.
	Parent should return a DIB.
	? Other platforms - Win16, Win32s ?


Owner drawn objects
	Use a notification to allow the parent window to control owner drawn areas.
	Could use <object width="" height="" name=""> and a notification could pass
	the attribs plus a handle to the DC.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Printing?? Don't know how yet???	** DONE **	Doesn't support wider than page prints automatically though.
	RG>	I'd like to take a look at this problem. I have some ideas... but I need to see
		the source before drawing any conclusions.
	This needs to be able to print the entire document unaided. Or, print sections of the document
	in a section of a DC e.g. I might have a complex print where I only want to print the HTML in a section
	of my total page.
	Scaling?
	????We might want to enquire how large a HTML document is on paper????

Multiple font names in FONT Face attributes.	** DONE **

Cache images of the same name within a document. ** DONE **
	richg will do this.
	RG> Images are cached for a single doument only.

Horizontal scrolling ** DONE ** See Comment
	richg will do this.
	RG>	should centered items be centered in the window, or in the total width
		that necessitated scrolling in the first place?
		Answer: Center them in the window.

Proper links when split over multiple lines. ** DONE **
	Links currently do not work correctly when split over multiple lines. The current
	solution links okay but when the link is highlighted it should highlight both links
	(or multiple links if there are many - could be many + images).
	Maybe we should have a list of links held in the HTMLSection, thus the link could
	notify it's parent of the state change and the HTMLSection could then notify all the
	other links.

NOWRAP in a table cell. - ** DONE **
	This is a little difficult because it would require two passes over a table. One pass would
	layout all of the table cells and find the widest cells. The second pass would be to *really*
	layout the cells.
	In the first pass we could just layout the cells that have this attribute and nothing else,
	this would be quicker.
	RG>	A two pass procedure might be needed anyway, because of the table layout bug I found. 
		It seems that the innermost table in a nested table setting would have to have it's
		height determined before the outer cells height can be determined, etc. 

Table borders. - ** DONE **
	Should be quite simple. Just need to record the table cell rect when iterating over each
	cell in the section creator. Then, when done go over our list of rects and create a border.
	? does each cell shrink or grow by the size of the border ?
	RG>	I believe that the cells grow. Otherwise it would be difficult to preset the size of
		a cell that contained an image, for example. The Entire Area occupied by the cell
		if the sum of the cell's contents, the cellpadding, the cell's portion of the 
		cellspacing, and the border.

Table background colours ** DONE **
	Similar to borders I guess.


Table cell spacing. ** DONE **
	No idea how this works - need to experiment and read the 4.0 spec.	
	RG>	I believe that cellpadding is the margin about the interior of the cell,
		cellspacing is the margin between cells.


Table cell background colours. ** DONE **
	Simple creation of a section the same size as a tabel cell. Should not be a big problem


Specify hotlinks colours. ** DONE **
	Relatively easy job, currnetly they use static fucntions to acquire the link colours.
	RG> This is done, but I think we need a master list of links so that split
		links behave properly. The link properties could then be saved there, and save a few bytes
		as well. Each HTMLSectionABC would have a pointer to a link structure in
		the document. This is similar to the image pointers, which also belong in the document.
